# ArchEclipse .gitignore
# ===========================================
# Strategy: Ignore EVERYTHING by default, then whitelist specific files.
# This prevents personal files from being tracked accidentally.
#
# Personal folders automatically ignored (by /* rule):
#   - Documents/, Downloads/, Pictures/, Music/, Videos/
#   - Desktop/, Games/, dev_proyects/
#   - .cache/, .local/, .mozilla/, .steam/
#   - Any *.log, *.blend, or other personal files
#
# Rice folders in ~/ that ARE tracked (part of upstream):
#   - wofi/, wofifull/, mako/, swaylock/ (legacy, not in active use)
#   - waybar/, waybarBackUp/ (legacy, replaced by AGS)
#   - themes/, scripts/, configs/ (active, part of rice)
#   - hypr/, hyprland.conf, hyprpaper.conf (core rice)
